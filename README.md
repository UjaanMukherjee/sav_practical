A minimal Flutter project created for you.

## Quick start

1. Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. From project root run:
   - `flutter pub get`
   - `flutter run` (select a device/emulator)

If you want platform folders (Android/iOS/web) generated, run `flutter create .` in the project root.
